### Joshua Ho | Data Science Student @ Purdue University 💻

## Introduction 👋🏼
Hello, my name is Joshua Ho and I am from the Bay Area more specifically Silicon Valley. Growing up, I have always wanted to learn how to code since I have always wondered how video games and websites worked. Living in the convenient location of Silicon Valley, I had access to numerous resources to proliferate my coding knowledge. Now that I have stepped foot onto Purdue University, my journey continues.
